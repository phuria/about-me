## About Me
I'm software developer with several years of practical experience.
I have the greatest knowledge of PHP language and web applications are my domain.
However, language is only tool for me.
Depending on needs, I can use Python or Java.
My code is focused on the readability, simplicity and reliability.
In addition, it must be: easy to test, easy to extend, easy to reuse
and fast as lightning.
